*** README ****

This script synchronizes the file contents of two directories and then
does a verification step by calculating the md5 on the remote side in a file called md5sums.txt

The md5sums.txt must already exist on the src (source) side.

-- NOTES --

1. 
md5sums.txt file (containing md5 sum of files) is generated by the following command:
md5sum --tag * | sort > ~/md5sum_local.txt


2. Script is limited at 3072kbps transfer speed.
   If you need more than that, edit this at line 15 in rsync_sync.sh
